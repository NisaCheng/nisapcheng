				<h3 id="intro">I'm an aspiring Los Angeles Based Web Developer. </h3>
		
				<p id="aboutMe"> I was 12 years old when I first coded in HTML. 
				It was during the Myspace ages and before the marquee tag became obsolete.  For the next 10 years, I I was unsure of what career to pursue. One day, I decided to revisit HTML and to my surprise, it has evolved much over the years. I had to reteach myself it all over again  and eventually, it became more natural to me and I found myself eager to create websites and seeing my ideas spring forth to life. I went forward with CSS and Javascript and enrolled in courses to cement and enrich my knowledge further. I am one semester away from receiving my AS Degree in Web Development at Long Beach City College and will transfer to California State University Dominguez Hills to receive a BS in Information Technology as well. I can proudly say I am experienced in HTML, CSS, Javascript and other programming languages such as Java, PHP, and mySQL.
				  I view myself as a hard worker able to collaborate with a team and with an eye for innovative design.I hope to hone the skills and qualities of a good developer in the future and to grow further professionally.
